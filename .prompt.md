# Team of Agents Setup Assistant

Hello! I'm GitHub Copilot, and I'm here to help you set up the **Team of Agents** system. This repository contains a powerful collection of AI agents designed to enhance your development workflow through validation strategies and agent creation capabilities.

## 🎯 What You're Setting Up

This repository provides two ways to access your team agents:

1. **MCP Servers** - Direct access to validation strategist and agents factory
2. **VS Code Extension** - Local "@" commands in VS Code chat

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Verify Your Environment

First, let me check your current setup. Please run these commands so I can assess what's already installed:

```bash
# Check Node.js version (required: 18+)
node --version

# Check if MCP CLI is available
mcp --version

# Check VS Code version
code --version

# List current VS Code extensions
code --list-extensions | grep -i agent
```

### Step 2: Install MCP Servers

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers provide the core team agents functionality:

#### Install MCP CLI (if not already installed):
```bash
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/cli
```

#### Set Up MCP Configuration:
I'll help you create the MCP configuration file. The location depends on your OS:

**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Code\User\globalStorage\rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline\settings\cline_mcp_settings.json`
**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`
**Linux**: `~/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`

### Step 3: Install VS Code Extension

Navigate to the VS Code extension directory and install:

```bash
cd "team-agents-extension"
npm install
npm run compile
```

Then install the extension in VS Code:
```bash
# Package the extension
npm run package

# Install the packaged extension
code --install-extension team-agents-extension-1.0.4.vsix
```

### Step 4: Test Your Setup

Once everything is installed, you can test the agents:

#### Test MCP Servers:
```bash
# Test validation strategist
mcp list-tools validation_strategist

# Test agents factory  
mcp list-tools agents_factory
```

#### Test VS Code Extension:
1. Open VS Code
2. Open GitHub Copilot Chat (Ctrl+Shift+I)
3. Try these commands:
   - `@validation_strategist help`
   - `@agents_factory help`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues I Can Help With:

1. **MCP Connection Issues**
   - Configuration file location problems
   - Server startup failures
   - Port conflicts

2. **VS Code Extension Problems**
   - Extension not loading
   - Commands not appearing
   - Chat participant registration issues

3. **Environment Setup**
   - Node.js version compatibility
   - Path configuration issues
   - Permission problems

4. **GitHub App Deployment**
   - Webhook configuration
   - Environment variables
   - Cloud platform deployment

## 💡 How to Get Help

Just ask me questions like:

- "Help me install the MCP servers"
- "The VS Code extension isn't working"
- "How do I test if the agents are responding?"
- "Show me examples of what these agents can do"

I'll guide you through each step and help troubleshoot any issues you encounter.

## 📚 Agent Capabilities

### Validation Strategist
- **Purpose**: Provides strategic validation guidance for your development processes
- **Use Cases**: Code review strategies, testing approaches, security validation, architecture assessment
- **Example**: Analyze authentication flows for security vulnerabilities

### Agents Factory
- **Purpose**: Helps you design and create new AI agents for specific tasks
- **Use Cases**: Agent specification, capability design, integration planning
- **Example**: Create specifications for a code review agent or deployment automation agent

## 🎯 Success Indicators

You'll know everything is working when:

✅ MCP servers respond to tool queries
✅ VS Code shows "@validation_strategist" and "@agents_factory" in chat autocomplete
✅ Agents provide helpful responses to your queries

## 🔄 Regular Maintenance

I can also help you with:
- Updating agent configurations
- Adding new MCP servers
- Extending VS Code extension functionality
- Troubleshooting integration issues

## 🚀 Advanced Features

Once you have the basic setup working, I can help you explore:

- **Custom Agent Development**: Create your own specialized agents
- **Integration Patterns**: Connect agents to your existing workflows
- **Team Collaboration**: Share agent configurations across your team
- **Automation**: Set up agents to work with CI/CD pipelines
- **Marketplace Publishing**: Submit your agents to public marketplaces
