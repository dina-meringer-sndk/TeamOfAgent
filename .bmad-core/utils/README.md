# Utilities

This directory contains utility scripts and tools that support the Agents Factory operations.

## Available Utilities

### Document Processing
- `docx_utils.py` - Microsoft Word document creation and manipulation
  - Convert Markdown to DOCX format
  - Read existing DOCX files
  - Format documents with proper styling

### File Management
- `file_ops.py` - File and directory operations (planned)
- `backup_utils.py` - Agent backup and restore functions (planned)
- `validation_utils.py` - BMAD compliance validation (planned)

## Utility Standards

All utilities should:
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Provide clear function documentation
- Support both command-line and programmatic usage
- Follow Python best practices
- Include usage examples

## Usage Patterns

### Document Generation
```python
from utils.docx_utils import create_docx_from_md

# Convert markdown to Word document
md_content = "# Title\n\nContent here..."
create_docx_from_md(md_content, "output.docx")
```

### Integration with Agent Workflows
Utilities are automatically used by:
- Task workflows for document generation
- Template processing systems
- Quality validation processes
- Backup and recovery operations

## Development Guidelines

When creating new utilities:
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each utility should have a focused purpose
2. **Reusability**: Design for use across multiple workflows
3. **Error Handling**: Robust error management and recovery
4. **Documentation**: Clear docstrings and usage examples
5. **Testing**: Include test cases and validation
6. **Dependencies**: Minimize external dependencies when possible

## Maintenance

- Review utilities quarterly for performance and reliability
- Update dependencies and security patches
- Refactor based on usage patterns and feedback
- Archive obsolete utilities appropriately
- Maintain compatibility with agent workflows
