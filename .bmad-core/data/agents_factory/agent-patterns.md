# Agent Design Patterns

## Common Agent Architectures

### 1. Task-Oriented Agent
**Purpose**: Agents focused on specific, well-defined tasks
**Structure**:
- Single primary task with supporting sub-tasks
- Clear input/output definitions
- Minimal external dependencies
- Focused command set

**Example Use Cases**:
- Document processor
- Data analyzer
- File converter
- Report generator

### 2. Workflow Orchestrator
**Purpose**: Agents that coordinate multiple processes and tools
**Structure**:
- Multiple interconnected tasks
- Rich command interface
- Integration with external tools
- State management capabilities

**Example Use Cases**:
- Project manager
- Build coordinator
- Testing orchestrator
- Deployment manager

### 3. Interactive Assistant
**Purpose**: Agents designed for ongoing user interaction
**Structure**:
- Conversational interface
- Session state management
- Dynamic command generation
- User preference learning

**Example Use Cases**:
- Personal assistant
- Learning tutor
- Technical support
- Creative collaborator

### 4. Knowledge Processor
**Purpose**: Agents that work with large knowledge bases
**Structure**:
- Data ingestion capabilities
- Search and retrieval functions
- Analysis and synthesis tools
- Report generation

**Example Use Cases**:
- Research assistant
- Documentation manager
- Knowledge synthesizer
- Information curator

- Progress tracking
- User notification systems

## Integration Patterns

### Tool Integration
- Standard interface definitions
- Error handling and fallbacks
- Configuration management
- Version compatibility

### Data Integration
- Clear data flow definitions
- Format standardization
