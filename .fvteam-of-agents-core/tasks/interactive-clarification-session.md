# Interactive Clarification Session Task

## Purpose

Conduct collaborative clarification sessions with users to resolve ambiguities, conflicts, or missing information discovered during PlantUML validation or project analysis. This ensures test code generation proceeds with complete, accurate requirements that align with project needs.

## SEQUENTIAL Task Execution (Do not proceed until current Task is complete)

### 1. Issue Categorization and Prioritization

- **Analyze identified issues** from validation or analysis phases
- **Categorize by type**: syntax errors, semantic ambiguities, integration conflicts, missing information
- **Prioritize by impact**: blocking issues, quality concerns, optimization opportunities
- **Prepare clear explanations** for each issue with context and implications
- **Organize interactive session** structure for efficient resolution

### 2. Structured Issue Presentation

- **Present issues systematically** starting with highest priority blocking items
- **Provide clear context** for each issue with specific examples
- **Explain impact on test generation** and code quality
- **Offer potential solutions** or approaches when possible
- **Request specific clarification** using targeted questions

### 3. Collaborative Problem Solving

- **Engage user in solution exploration** for each identified issue
- **Document user responses** and clarification decisions
- **Validate understanding** by repeating back user intentions
- **Identify additional requirements** that emerge during discussion
- **Capture any new constraints** or preferences revealed

### 4. Conflict Resolution

- **Address integration conflicts** between UML and existing project patterns
- **Explore alternative approaches** that maintain architectural integrity
- **Negotiate trade-offs** between ideal design and practical constraints
- **Document resolution decisions** with rationale for future reference
- **Ensure alignment** with project standards and team preferences

### 5. Session Documentation and Validation

- **Create comprehensive session summary** with all decisions and clarifications
- **Validate user agreement** on all resolved issues and approaches
- **Update project knowledge base** with new information discovered
- **Generate updated requirements** for test code generation
- **Confirm readiness** to proceed with clarified specifications

## Blocking Conditions

- User unavailable for clarification session
- Critical issues require architect input beyond user authority
- Unresolvable conflicts between UML and project architecture
- Missing information that cannot be clarified without additional project stakeholders
- User requests to halt process for external consultation

## Success Criteria

- All identified issues successfully clarified or resolved
- User agreement obtained on all solutions and approaches
- Updated requirements documented with complete specifications
- Project knowledge base enhanced with session discoveries
- Clear path forward established for test code generation

## Dependencies

This task depends on:
- Validation results from validate-plantuml-input.md
- Project knowledge from learn-project-context.md
- project-integration-checklist.md for conflict resolution guidance
- brownfield-integration-patterns.md for alternative approaches

## Outputs

This task produces:
- Interactive session summary with all clarifications and decisions
- Updated and validated requirements for test code generation
- Enhanced project knowledge base with discovered information
- Conflict resolution documentation with rationale
- Confirmed specifications ready for code generation phase
