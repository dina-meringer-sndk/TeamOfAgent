# Generate Specific Sections Task

## Purpose

Generate specific sections of validation plans on-demand, allowing for incremental plan development, targeted updates, and customized content generation based on user requirements.

## SEQUENTIAL Task Execution (Do not proceed until current Task is complete)

### 1. Section Generation Request Analysis

**Identify requested section type:**
- Test case specifications

- Stakeholder alignment sections
- Traceability matrices
- Risk assessment sections

**Gather section-specific requirements:**
- Section scope and boundaries
- Required detail level and format
- Integration requirements with existing content
- Template and structure preferences

### 2. Context and Dependency Analysis

**Analyze existing content context:**
- Review current validation plan structure
- Identify section dependencies and relationships
- Assess impact of new section on overall plan
- Validate consistency with existing content

**Dependency requirement gathering:**
- Required input data and information
- Stakeholder input requirements
- Technical constraint considerations
- Integration points with other sections

### 4. Template-Driven Content Generation

**Apply appropriate templates:**
- Select optimal template for requested section type
- Customize template variables based on context
- Apply domain expertise enhancements
- Ensure enterprise quality standards compliance
- Integrate with existing plan structure

**Quality and consistency validation:**
- Validate content against quality standards
- Ensure consistency with existing plan sections
- Verify technical accuracy and feasibility
- Confirm stakeholder requirement alignment

### 5. Advanced Section Enhancement

**Domain expertise application:**
- Apply 15+ years validation expertise
- Include industry best practices
- Add proven methodology recommendations
- Enhance with lessons learned insights

**Failure mode prevention integration:**
- Apply failure mode analysis patterns
- Include prevention measures specific to section
- Add risk mitigation strategies
- Ensure comprehensive coverage protection

### 6. Integration and Consistency Management

**Section integration planning:**
- Plan integration with existing plan structure
- Identify required updates to related sections
- Assess impact on overall plan organization
- Plan version control and change management

**Consistency validation:**
- Ensure terminology consistency across sections
- Validate technical approach alignment
- Confirm stakeholder requirement consistency
- Verify quality standard compliance

### 7. Output Generation and Formatting

**Generate section content:**
- Apply appropriate formatting for section type
- Include all required subsections and details
- Add proper references and traceability
- Ensure professional presentation quality

**Multiple format generation:**
- Generate Word document compatible content
- Create Confluence format version
- Include structured data formats where appropriate
- Add integration guidelines for implementation

### 8. Validation and Quality Assurance

**Section quality validation:**
- Apply quality_validator.py for automated checking
- Execute relevant quality checklists
- Validate against technical constraints
- Confirm stakeholder requirement satisfaction

**Integration testing:**
- Test section integration with existing content
- Validate overall plan structure integrity
- Confirm cross-reference accuracy
- Verify version compatibility

### 9. Delivery and Implementation Support

**Section delivery:**
- Provide generated section with integration instructions
- Include quality validation results
- Add implementation timeline recommendations
- Provide stakeholder review guidelines

**Implementation support:**
- Offer integration assistance
- Provide update recommendations for related sections
- Include maintenance and evolution guidance
- Support stakeholder review and approval process
