# Facilitate Brainstorming Session Task

## Purpose

Guide the user through an engaging, collaborative brainstorming session to discover and define all requirements for creating a complete FVTeamOfAgents agent ecosystem. Uses proven elicitation techniques from brainstorming-techniques.md to ensure comprehensive requirement gathering while maintaining user engagement and creativity.

## SEQUENTIAL Task Execution (Do not proceed until current Task is complete)

### 1. Session Setup and Rapport Building

**Ask 4 context questions (don't preview what happens next):**

1. **What are we brainstorming about?** (Get their initial agent vision)
2. **Any constraints or parameters?** (Technical, organizational, resource limits)
3. **Goal: broad exploration or focused ideation?** (Scope and depth preference)
4. **Do you want a structured document output to reference later?** (Default Yes)

**OPENING ENERGY:**
- "Let's co-create something amazing together! We're going to design your ideal AI agent."
- "Think of this as an architect-client conversation where we're designing your dream house, but for an AI agent."
- **Session Contract**: "This will be collaborative - I'll ask questions, but feel free to interrupt with ideas, concerns, or 'what ifs' at any time."

**EXPECTATION SETTING:**
- Duration: "15-25 minutes of focused exploration"
- Outcome: "A complete blueprint for your agent ecosystem with all supporting infrastructure"
- Process: "We'll use creative thinking techniques to uncover needs you might not have considered"

**ENERGY CHECK:**
- "On a scale of 1-10, how excited are you about this agent idea?"
- "What's driving your enthusiasm for creating this agent?"

### 1.5. Present Approach Options

After getting answers to Step 1, present 4 approach options (numbered):

1. **User selects specific techniques** - You choose from our technique library
2. **Agent recommends techniques** - I suggest best techniques based on your context
3. **Random technique selection** - For creative variety and unexpected insights
4. **Progressive technique flow** - Start broad, narrow down systematically

**Wait for user selection before proceeding**

### 2. Execute Techniques Interactively

**KEY PRINCIPLES:**

- **FACILITATOR ROLE**: Guide user to generate their own ideas through questions, prompts, and examples
- **CONTINUOUS ENGAGEMENT**: Keep user engaged with chosen technique until they want to switch or are satisfied
- **CAPTURE OUTPUT**: If (default) document output requested, capture all ideas generated in each technique section from the beginning.

**Technique Selection:**
If user selects Option 1, present numbered list of techniques from the brainstorming-techniques.md data file. User can select by number.

If user selects Option 2, recommend 2-3 specific techniques based on their context:
- **For unclear vision**: Start with Analogical Thinking → What If Scenarios
- **For complex systems**: Use Six Thinking Hats → Role Playing
- **For creative exploration**: Try Random Stimulation → Forced Relationships
- **For focused refinement**: Apply Five Whys → First Principles Thinking

**Technique Execution:**

1. **Apply selected technique** according to brainstorming-techniques.md description
2. **Monitor engagement** and energy levels throughout
3. **Adapt in real-time** based on user responses and energy
4. **Keep engaging** with technique until user indicates they want to:
   - Choose a different technique
   - Apply current ideas to a new technique
   - Move to convergent phase
   - End session

**Output Capture (if requested):**
For each technique used, capture in real-time:
- Technique name and duration
- Key ideas generated by user (in their own words)
- Insights and patterns identified
- User's reflections on the process
- Notable connections or breakthrough moments

**Energy Management:**
- **High Energy**: Use fast-paced techniques (Random Stimulation, What If Scenarios)
- **Medium Energy**: Use structured approaches (SCAMPER, Six Thinking Hats)
- **Low Energy**: Use reflective techniques (Five Whys, First Principles)
- **Energy Recovery**: Switch techniques, celebrate progress, check enthusiasm

### 3. Session Flow Management

**Follow proven flow patterns:**

1. **Warm-up** (5-10 min) - Build creative confidence with easy wins
2. **Divergent** (15-25 min) - Generate quantity over quality using multiple techniques
3. **Convergent** (10-15 min) - Group and categorize ideas using structured approaches
4. **Synthesis** (10-15 min) - Refine and develop concepts into actionable requirements

**Technique Transitions:**
- Always ask before switching: "Ready to try a different approach?"
- Offer options: "Should we explore this idea deeper or generate more alternatives?"
- Respect their process and timing
- Celebrate what was accomplished before moving on

**Advanced Engagement Strategies:**

**Energy Management**
- Check engagement levels: "How are you feeling about this direction?"
- Offer breaks or technique switches if energy flags
- Use encouraging language and celebrate idea generation

**Depth vs. Breadth**
- Ask follow-up questions to deepen ideas: "Tell me more about that..."
- Use "Yes, and..." to build on their ideas
- Help them make connections: "How does this relate to your earlier idea about...?"

**Real-time Adaptation**
- Monitor for signs of fatigue or frustration
- Switch techniques if current approach isn't working
- Adjust complexity based on user's response patterns

### 4. Core Agent Vision Discovery (Using Selected Techniques)

**APPLY CHOSEN TECHNIQUES TO EXPLORE:**

- **Target Directory**: "Where should we build this agent's home base? (Provide full path for .fvteam-of-agents-core structure)"
- **Check Existing Structure**: If .fvteam-of-agents-core exists, analyze and celebrate existing components

**Core Mission Exploration:**
- Use First Principles: "What's the most fundamental problem this agent must solve?"
- Use What If Scenarios: "What if this agent could only do one thing perfectly?"
- **Success Vision**: "Picture 6 months from now - your agent is wildly successful. What's happening?"

**User Empathy Discovery:**
