## Completeness Assessment Workflow

### Step 1: Package Inventory
1. **Document Catalog**:
   - Validation strategy document
   - Architecture analysis report
   - Risk assessment report
   - Test coverage matrix
   - Test case documentation
   - Supporting artifacts

2. **Artifact Quality Check**:
   - Document completeness verification
   - Version control validation
   - Format consistency check
   - Professional presentation review

### Step 2: Coverage Analysis
1. **Requirement Coverage Assessment**:
   - Functional requirement coverage: ____%
   - Non-functional requirement coverage: ____%
   - Integration requirement coverage: ____%
   - Compliance requirement coverage: ____%

2. **Test Coverage Evaluation**:
   - Unit test coverage adequacy
   - Integration test scope completeness
   - System test scenario coverage
   - Performance test coverage
   - Security test coverage
   - Acceptance test coverage

### Step 3: Quality Standards Validation
1. **Enterprise Standards Compliance**:
   - Documentation standards adherence
   - Process methodology compliance
   - Quality gate satisfaction
   - Audit trail completeness

2. **Industry Best Practices**:
   - Risk-based testing approach
   - Traceability matrix completeness
   - Test automation readiness
   - Continuous validation integration

### Step 4: Gap Identification
1. **Coverage Gaps**:
   - Uncovered requirements identification
   - Missing test scenarios
   - Inadequate test categories
   - Insufficient validation depth

2. **Process Gaps**:
   - Missing validation activities
   - Inadequate review processes
   - Insufficient stakeholder involvement
   - Weak change management

3. **Resource Gaps**:
   - Insufficient testing resources
   - Missing tooling requirements
   - Inadequate expertise coverage
   - Timeline constraints

### Step 5: Risk Assessment
1. **Gap Impact Analysis**:
   - Critical gaps requiring immediate attention
   - High-impact gaps with medium urgency
   - Medium-impact gaps for planned improvement
   - Low-impact gaps for future consideration

2. **Mitigation Priority**:
   - P0: Critical gaps blocking release
   - P1: Important gaps affecting quality
   - P2: Improvement opportunities
   - P3: Enhancement suggestions
