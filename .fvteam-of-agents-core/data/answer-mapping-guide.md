# Advanced Answer Mapping Guide

## Purpose
Comprehensive rules for categorizing brainstorming session answers into correct file types during agent ecosystem creation, with advanced pattern recognition and content sophistication mapping.

## Core Mapping Principles

### Content Type Recognition Framework

**Sequential Process Indicators** → TASK FILES
- **Language Patterns**: "First...", "Then...", "After that...", "Finally..."
- **Conditional Logic**: "If X happens...", "When Y occurs...", "In case of..."
- **Action Sequences**: "Step 1:", "Next step:", "Following completion..."
- **Decision Points**: "Choose between...", "Evaluate whether...", "Determine if..."
- **User Interactions**: "Ask user for...", "Get confirmation...", "Wait for input..."

**Structure and Format Indicators** → TEMPLATE FILES  
- **Document Language**: "Should include sections...", "Format contains...", "Layout has..."
- **Variable Content**: "Users fill in...", "Data goes here...", "Replace with..."
- **Output Descriptions**: "Report shows...", "Document contains...", "Summary includes..."
- **Format Specifications**: "Table with columns...", "List of items...", "Paragraph describing..."
- **Template Language**: "Standard format", "Consistent structure", "Reusable layout"

**Quality and Standards Indicators** → CHECKLIST FILES
- **Validation Language**: "Must meet...", "Should comply with...", "Check that..."
- **Quality Criteria**: "Good means...", "Excellence includes...", "Standards require..."
- **Review Processes**: "Verify that...", "Confirm whether...", "Validate..."
- **Compliance Terms**: "Follows guidelines...", "Meets requirements...", "Adheres to..."
- **Pass/Fail Logic**: "Acceptable if...", "Reject when...", "Approve only when..."

**Knowledge and Information Indicators** → DATA FILES
- **Fact Statements**: "Important to know...", "Key information...", "Facts include..."
- **Reference Material**: "Examples of...", "Best practices...", "Guidelines state..."
- **Domain Expertise**: "Experts recommend...", "Studies show...", "Research indicates..."
- **Rules and Principles**: "Always remember...", "Never do...", "Generally..."
- **Background Context**: "History shows...", "Context includes...", "Background is..."

**Technical and System Indicators** → UTILITY FILES
- **Integration Language**: "Connects to...", "Interfaces with...", "Calls API..."
- **File Operations**: "Reads from...", "Writes to...", "Processes files..."
- **Data Processing**: "Transforms data...", "Converts format...", "Parses information..."
- **System Actions**: "Automates...", "Triggers...", "Executes..."
- **External Dependencies**: "Requires access to...", "Depends on...", "Uses service..."

## Advanced Content Sophistication Mapping

### Multi-Dimensional Analysis

**Complexity Level Assessment:**
- **Simple**: Direct, single-purpose content
- **Moderate**: Multi-step or conditional content  
- **Complex**: Multi-branched logic with exceptions
- **Advanced**: Adaptive or learning-based content

**User Interaction Depth:**
- **Minimal**: Fire-and-forget operations
- **Interactive**: Guided user input and feedback
- **Collaborative**: Multi-party coordination
- **Adaptive**: Personalized based on user behavior

**Integration Sophistication:**
- **Standalone**: Independent operation
- **Connected**: Simple data exchange
- **Integrated**: Workflow handoffs and coordination
- **Orchestrated**: Complex multi-agent coordination

## Content Quality Assessment

**Completeness Levels:**
- **Comprehensive**: Covers all aspects with examples
- **Adequate**: Covers main points with some detail  
- **Basic**: Covers minimum requirements only
- **Incomplete**: Missing critical information

**Specificity Levels:**
- **Highly Specific**: Detailed, actionable, context-rich
- **Moderately Specific**: Clear but general guidance
- **Generic**: Basic, broadly applicable information
- **Vague**: Unclear content requiring clarification

## Cross-Content Analysis

**Business Rules** → DATA FILES (reference) + CHECKLIST FILES (validation)
**User Interactions** → TASK FILES (workflow) + TEMPLATE FILES (input gathering)  
**System Integration** → UTILITY FILES (connection) + DATA FILES (system info)
**Quality Standards** → CHECKLIST FILES (validation) + DATA FILES (best practices)

## Validation Process
After each brainstorming section, confirm mapping:
- "I'll create [N] task files for [workflows], [N] template files for [content types], etc."
- "Does this categorization sound right, or should anything be mapped differently?"
- Check for missing components or overlaps between categories
