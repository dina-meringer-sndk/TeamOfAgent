# Brainstorming Techniques for Agent Creation

## Core Techniques (Use these 12 most effective techniques)

### Creative Expansion
1. **What If Scenarios**: Ask provocative questions to explore possibilities
   - "What if this agent had unlimited access to data?"
   - "What if users could only interact with it for 30 seconds?"

2. **Analogical Thinking**: Use analogies to clarify agent purpose
   - "If your agent were a person in your organization, what would their job title be?"
   - "Your agent is like a ___ because..."

3. **Reversal/Inversion**: Explore by asking the opposite
   - "What would the worst possible version of this agent do?"
   - "How would you make this agent completely useless?"

### Structured Exploration
4. **Five Whys**: Dig deeper into underlying needs
   - Ask "why" and wait for answer before next "why"
   - Uncover fundamental requirements and motivations

5. **SCAMPER Method**: Systematic idea modification
   - **S**ubstitute, **C**ombine, **A**dapt, **M**odify, **P**ut to other uses, **E**liminate, **R**everse
   - Go through one letter at a time

6. **Six Thinking Hats**: Explore different perspectives
   - White (facts), Red (emotions), Black (problems), Yellow (benefits), Green (creativity), Blue (process)

### Collaborative Building
7. **"Yes, And..." Building**: Build on ideas positively
   - They give idea, you "yes and" it, they "yes and" back
   - Create momentum and encourage wild ideas

8. **Mind Mapping**: Visual exploration from central concept
   - Start with agent core purpose
   - Branch out to capabilities and implementation

### Deep Exploration
9. **Role Playing**: Explore from different user perspectives
   - Novice user, Expert user, Administrator viewpoints
   - "How would each type of user interact with this agent?"

10. **Assumption Reversal**: Challenge core beliefs
    - "What if users didn't want efficiency?"
    - "What if more features made it worse?"

### Agent-Specific
11. **Failure Mode Exploration**: Explore what could go wrong
    - "When would users get frustrated with this agent?"
    - "What would make this agent give bad advice?"

12. **Random Stimulation**: Use unexpected prompts for creativity
    - Random words: "How does 'bicycle' relate to your agent?"
    - Force connections between unrelated concepts

## Energy Management

**High Energy**: Random Stimulation, What If Scenarios, Role Playing
**Medium Energy**: SCAMPER, Six Thinking Hats, Mind Mapping  
**Low Energy**: Five Whys, Analogical Thinking, Assumption Reversal
