# Architecture Patterns Knowledge Base

## Common ASIC Architecture Patterns

### 1. Hierarchical Architecture
- **Description**: Top-down modular design with clear hierarchy
- **Validation Approach**: Layer-by-layer validation starting from bottom modules
- **Key Considerations**: Interface dependencies, signal propagation timing
- **Risk Areas**: Cross-layer communication, timing closure

### 2. Pipeline Architecture
- **Description**: Sequential processing stages with data flow
- **Validation Approach**: Stage-by-stage validation with data path verification
- **Key Considerations**: Pipeline depth, throughput, latency
- **Risk Areas**: Pipeline stalls, data hazards, timing violations

### 3. Bus Architecture
- **Description**: Shared communication infrastructure
- **Validation Approach**: Protocol compliance, arbitration, data integrity
- **Key Considerations**: Bus width, protocol standards, arbitration schemes
- **Risk Areas**: Bus contention, protocol violations, deadlocks

## Firmware Architecture Patterns

### 1. Layered Architecture
- **Description**: Software layers with defined interfaces
- **Validation Approach**: API testing, layer isolation, integration testing
- **Key Considerations**: Layer boundaries, abstraction levels, performance
- **Risk Areas**: Layer violations, performance bottlenecks

### 2. State Machine Architecture
- **Description**: Finite state machines controlling system behavior
- **Validation Approach**: State coverage, transition testing, error handling
- **Key Considerations**: State explosion, timing constraints, error recovery
- **Risk Areas**: Invalid transitions, deadlock states, timing violations

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture
- **Description**: Asynchronous event processing and handling
- **Validation Approach**: Event sequence testing, timing validation, stress testing
- **Key Considerations**: Event priorities, queue management, real-time constraints
- **Risk Areas**: Event storms, timing violations, resource exhaustion

## System Architecture Patterns

### 1. Distributed Architecture
- **Description**: Multiple interconnected processing nodes
- **Validation Approach**: Node isolation, inter-node communication, fault tolerance
- **Key Considerations**: Network topology, communication protocols, fault tolerance
- **Risk Areas**: Network partitions, communication failures, synchronization issues

### 2. Microservices Architecture
- **Description**: Small, independent, loosely coupled services
- **Validation Approach**: Service isolation, API testing, integration testing
- **Key Considerations**: Service boundaries, data consistency, performance
- **Risk Areas**: Service dependencies, data consistency, cascade failures

### 3. Monolithic Architecture
- **Description**: Single deployable unit with all functionality
- **Validation Approach**: Component testing, integration testing, system testing
- **Key Considerations**: Module coupling, scalability, maintainability
- **Risk Areas**: Tight coupling, single points of failure, scalability limits

## Validation Strategy Mapping

### Pattern-Specific Validation Strategies
1. **Hierarchical**: Bottom-up validation approach
2. **Pipeline**: Flow-through validation with stage verification
3. **Event-Driven**: Scenario-based validation with timing focus
4. **Distributed**: Node-level and system-level validation
5. **State Machine**: State coverage and transition validation

### Common Validation Approaches
- **Black Box Testing**: External behavior validation
- **White Box Testing**: Internal structure validation
- **Gray Box Testing**: Combination approach with limited internal visibility
- **Model-Based Testing**: Abstract model validation and verification
