# Incomplete Session Handling

## Completion Assessment Framework

### Comprehensive (80%+ answered)
- **Approach**: Proceed with full ecosystem creation
- **Strategy**: All components well-defined with minimal placeholders

### Substantial (60-80% answered)  
- **Approach**: Create robust core with targeted placeholders
- **Strategy**: Include discovery workflows for missing elements

### Basic (40-60% answered)
- **Approach**: Create minimal viable agent with expansion framework
- **Strategy**: Heavy use of learning and discovery features

### Exploratory (<40% answered)
- **Approach**: Create discovery-focused agent that helps user learn their needs
- **Strategy**: Include brainstorming and analysis tools

## Adaptive Strategies by Component

### For Missing Workflows
- Create generic "user-guided workflow" templates
- Include "workflow discovery" tasks that help users identify needs
- Add "workflow wizard" that walks users through process mapping
- Create placeholder workflows with clear upgrade paths

### For Unclear Content Generation
- Generate flexible content templates with multiple format options
- Include "content requirements gathering" sub-agents
- Create example-driven templates that learn from user samples
- Add "content type discovery" workflows

### For Undefined Quality Standards
- Create basic quality checklists with industry standards
- Include "quality criteria refinement" tasks
- Add "quality learning" features that improve over time
- Generate adaptive quality checks based on outcomes

### For Missing Knowledge
- Create knowledge collection workflows
- Include "knowledge discovery" tasks
- Add "expert interview" templates for knowledge gathering
- Generate knowledge placeholders with research prompts

### For Uncertain Integrations
- Create file-based operation stubs
- Include "integration planning" workflows
- Add "system discovery" tasks
- Generate API connection templates for future use

## Placeholder Generation Rules
- All placeholders include clear "TODO" markers with completion instructions
- Each placeholder references learning resources and examples
- Evolution path documented for each missing component
- Placeholders collect user interaction data to guide future development

## User Communication Strategies

**Positive Uncertainty Framing:**
- "We can start with what you know and evolve the agent later"
- "This collaborative approach ensures your agent truly fits your needs"
- "Starting simple ensures you'll have a solid foundation to build upon"

**Maintain Momentum:**
- Focus on what they DO know rather than what they don't
- Celebrate each piece of information gathered
- Show how partial information leads to better, more adaptable agents

**Evolution Opportunity:**
- "Your agent will become more capable as you discover new requirements"
- "Every interaction will make it more useful and aligned with your needs"
- "We're creating a foundation that can support future capabilities"
