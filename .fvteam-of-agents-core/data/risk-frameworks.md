# Risk Assessment Frameworks Knowledge Base

## Risk Assessment Methodologies

### 1. FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis)
- **Purpose**: Systematic analysis of potential failure modes
- **Application**: Component-level and system-level risk assessment
- **Process**:
  1. Identify potential failure modes
  2. Analyze effects of each failure
  3. Assess severity, occurrence, and detection ratings
  4. Calculate Risk Priority Number (RPN)
  5. Develop mitigation strategies
- **Validation Focus**: High RPN items require intensive validation

### 2. HAZOP (Hazard and Operability Study)
- **Purpose**: Systematic examination of system hazards
- **Application**: Process and system safety analysis
- **Process**:
  1. Divide system into study nodes
  2. Apply guide words (More, Less, No, Reverse, etc.)
  3. Identify deviations and causes
  4. Assess consequences and safeguards
  5. Recommend actions
- **Validation Focus**: Critical hazard scenarios

### 3. Risk Matrix Analysis
- **Purpose**: Qualitative risk assessment using probability vs impact
- **Application**: Strategic risk prioritization
- **Categories**:
  - **Probability**: Very Low, Low, Medium, High, Very High
  - **Impact**: Negligible, Minor, Moderate, Major, Catastrophic
- **Risk Levels**: Low, Medium, High, Critical
- **Validation Focus**: High and Critical risk items

## Validation-Specific Risk Categories

### Technical Risks
1. **Complexity Risk**
   - High algorithmic complexity
   - Complex state machines
   - Intricate timing relationships
   - **Mitigation**: Incremental validation, model-based testing

2. **Interface Risk**
   - Multiple interfaces
   - Protocol complexity
   - Timing dependencies
   - **Mitigation**: Interface-specific testing, protocol compliance

3. **Integration Risk**
   - Component interactions
   - System-level behavior
   - Emergent properties
   - **Mitigation**: Integration testing, system-level validation

### Schedule Risks
1. **Resource Availability**
   - Test environment availability
   - Personnel allocation
   - Tool limitations
   - **Mitigation**: Resource planning, parallel activities

2. **Dependency Risk**
   - External component dependencies
   - Tool dependencies
   - Infrastructure dependencies
   - **Mitigation**: Dependency mapping, contingency plans

3. **Scope Creep**
   - Changing requirements
   - Additional features
   - Enhanced coverage expectations
   - **Mitigation**: Change control, scope management

## Risk Assessment Process

### Step 1: Risk Identification
- Brainstorming sessions
- Historical data analysis
- Expert judgment
- Checklist-based identification
- Scenario analysis

### Step 2: Risk Analysis
- Qualitative analysis (risk matrix)
- Quantitative analysis (probability calculations)
- Impact assessment
- Likelihood assessment
- Risk interdependency analysis

### Step 3: Risk Evaluation
- Risk ranking and prioritization
- Acceptable risk thresholds
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Stakeholder input
- Regulatory considerations

### Step 4: Risk Treatment
- **Avoid**: Eliminate risk sources
- **Mitigate**: Reduce probability or impact
- **Transfer**: Share or shift risk
- **Accept**: Acknowledge and monitor

### Step 5: Risk Monitoring
- Regular risk reviews
- Risk indicator tracking
- Mitigation effectiveness assessment
- New risk identification
- Risk communication

## Validation Strategy Integration

### Risk-Based Test Planning
1. **High Risk Areas**: Intensive testing, multiple techniques
2. **Medium Risk Areas**: Standard testing approaches
3. **Low Risk Areas**: Basic verification, sampling

### Risk-Driven Coverage
- Prioritize test scenarios based on risk levels
- Allocate resources to high-risk areas
- Define coverage metrics aligned with risk assessment
- Monitor risk reduction through validation activities

### Risk Communication
- Risk registers and dashboards
- Regular risk reports
- Stakeholder risk briefings
- Decision support documentation
