# Failure Mode Analysis Database

## Comprehensive Failure Mode Prevention Framework

### Process Failure Modes

#### 1. Ambiguity Blindness

**Detection Methods**:
- Requirement completeness scoring
- Assumption tracking and validation
- User feedback on requirement clarity
**Recovery Actions**:
- Return to requirement elicitation phase
- Conduct targeted clarification sessions
- Update requirement documentation with specifics

#### 2. Dependency Misses

- System-level interaction analysis using domain knowledge
- Integration scenario validation with stakeholders
- Dependency traceability matrix maintenance
**Detection Methods**:
- Cross-reference analysis of feature interactions
- Stakeholder review of integration scenarios
- Dependency gap analysis using knowledge patterns
**Recovery Actions**:
- Conduct comprehensive dependency assessment
- Add missing integration test scenarios
- Update validation plan with system-level testing

#### 3. Regression Gaps
**Description**: Fails to enforce coverage for backward compatibility or existing features that might break
**Impact**: New features break existing functionality without detection
**Prevention Strategies**:
- Systematic backward compatibility analysis
- Legacy feature impact assessment
- Regression test scenario generation
- Version compatibility validation
**Detection Methods**:
- Backward compatibility checklist validation
- Legacy system integration review
- Version comparison analysis
**Recovery Actions**:
- Add comprehensive regression testing scenarios
- Include backward compatibility validation
- Establish legacy system protection measures

#### 4. Evolving Spec Blind Spot
**Description**: When specifications change mid-cycle, agent doesn't adapt validation plan accordingly
**Impact**: Validation plan drifts out of sync with actual requirements
**Prevention Strategies**:
- Version control integration for specification tracking
- Change impact assessment procedures
- Adaptive plan update mechanisms
- Stakeholder notification systems for changes
**Detection Methods**:
- Specification version tracking
- Change impact analysis
- Plan-to-spec alignment validation
**Recovery Actions**:
- Re-analyze updated specifications
- Update validation plan to reflect changes
- Communicate changes to all stakeholders

### Quality Failure Modes

#### 5. Over-Validation/Noise
**Description**: Agent generates too many redundant test cases, overwhelming resources and reducing efficiency
**Impact**: Resource waste, delayed execution, reduced focus on critical areas
**Prevention Strategies**:
- Redundancy detection algorithms
- Test case value assessment
- Resource optimization analysis
- Priority-based test allocation
**Detection Methods**:
- Test case overlap analysis
- Resource utilization assessment
- Value-to-effort ratio calculation
**Recovery Actions**:
- Remove redundant test cases
- Consolidate overlapping scenarios
- Re-prioritize based on risk and value

#### 6. Prioritization Failure
**Description**: All tests treated equally, critical high-risk areas not prioritized for early execution
**Impact**: Critical bugs detected late, delayed project timelines, higher risk exposure
**Prevention Strategies**:
- Risk-based test prioritization
- Critical path analysis
- Business impact assessment
- Stakeholder input on priority areas
**Detection Methods**:
- Risk coverage analysis
- Priority distribution assessment
- Critical area validation review
**Recovery Actions**:
- Re-prioritize tests based on risk assessment
- Move critical tests to early phases
- Adjust resource allocation to high-priority areas

#### 7. Traceability Breaks
**Description**: Requirements not properly mapped to test cases, making coverage proof impossible
**Impact**: Cannot demonstrate compliance, audit failures, missing requirement coverage
**Prevention Strategies**:
- Automated requirement-to-test mapping
- Traceability matrix maintenance
- Coverage gap detection
- Regular traceability validation
**Detection Methods**:
- Traceability matrix completeness check
- Coverage analysis reporting
- Requirement mapping validation
**Recovery Actions**:
- Rebuild requirement-to-test traceability
- Add missing test cases for uncovered requirements
- Establish ongoing traceability maintenance

#### 8. Toolchain/Automation Assumptions
**Description**: Assumes infrastructure capabilities that don't exist, leading to unexecutable test plans
**Impact**: Test execution failures, implementation delays, resource waste
**Prevention Strategies**:
- Infrastructure capability validation
- Tool availability verification
- Execution environment assessment
- Feasibility confirmation with technical teams
**Detection Methods**:
- Infrastructure compatibility checks
- Tool availability validation
- Execution environment testing
**Recovery Actions**:
- Adjust test plans to available infrastructure
- Identify alternative execution methods
- Update infrastructure requirements

## Stakeholder-Specific Failure Modes

### System Architect Concerns

#### System Integration Failure
**Description**: Missing system-level validation that could compromise product integration
**Impact**: Integration failures, system instability, customer-visible issues
**Prevention**: Comprehensive system-level test scenario inclusion
**Detection**: System architect review and sign-off
**Recovery**: Add system integration test scenarios

#### Cross-Feature Dependency Failure
**Description**: Missing validation of feature interactions (power, performance, security)
**Impact**: Feature conflicts, system degradation, unexpected behaviors
**Prevention**: Cross-feature interaction matrix development
**Detection**: Cross-feature dependency review
**Recovery**: Add interaction validation scenarios

### FW Engineer Concerns

#### Technical Infeasibility
**Description**: Test scenarios that cannot be implemented with available FW infrastructure
**Impact**: Test execution failures, FW development delays
**Prevention**: FW capability validation during planning
**Detection**: FW engineer technical review
**Recovery**: Adjust tests to FW capabilities or update FW requirements

#### Resource Overcommitment
**Description**: FW support requirements exceed available resources
**Impact**: FW delivery delays, incomplete infrastructure support
**Prevention**: Resource capacity assessment during planning
**Detection**: FW resource availability review
**Recovery**: Prioritize FW requirements or adjust timeline

### Validation Engineer Concerns

#### Execution Impossibility
**Description**: Test procedures cannot be executed with available tools and environment
**Impact**: Test execution failures, validation delays
**Prevention**: Execution feasibility assessment during planning
**Detection**: Validation engineer executability review
**Recovery**: Modify test procedures for execution feasibility

#### Coverage Inefficiency
**Description**: Test coverage strategy inefficient, missing critical scenarios while over-testing others

**Detection**: Coverage efficiency review
**Recovery**: Optimize test coverage for maximum effectiveness

## Advanced Failure Modes

### Adaptive Failure Modes

#### Specification Evolution Lag
**Description**: Validation plan doesn't keep pace with evolving requirements
**Impact**: Outdated validation, missing new requirement coverage

### Meta-Failure Modes

#### Quality Process Failure
**Description**: Quality assurance process itself has gaps or failures
**Impact**: Undetected quality issues, systematic validation problems
**Prevention**: Quality process validation and continuous improvement
**Detection**: Quality metrics monitoring and meta-analysis
**Recovery**: Improve quality processes and re-execute validation

#### Stakeholder Alignment Drift
**Description**: Stakeholder expectations change but validation plan doesn't reflect updates
**Impact**: Stakeholder dissatisfaction, rejection of validation results
**Prevention**: Continuous stakeholder engagement and expectation management
**Detection**: Stakeholder satisfaction monitoring
**Recovery**: Re-align validation plan with current stakeholder expectations

This comprehensive failure mode analysis serves as the foundation for preventing all identified failure scenarios and ensuring robust, gap-free validation planning.
