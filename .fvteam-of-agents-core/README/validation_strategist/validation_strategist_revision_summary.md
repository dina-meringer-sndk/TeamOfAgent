# Validation Strategist Agent - Revision Summary

**Revision Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Revised by:** Factory 🏭 (Agents Factory)  
**Revision Type:** Folder Structure Restructure + Agent Name Update + Checklist Folder Correction  
**Agent:** Validation Strategist 🎯 (Validation Strategy Architect)

---

## Revision Overview

The validation_strategist agent has been successfully restructured from the original BMAD `.bmad-core` folder structure to a more intuitive, function-based organization that is easier for users to understand and navigate.

## User Requirements

The user requested:
> "I would like to re-structure the folders, since it is a bit confusing to people who are not familiar with bmad. Please suggest how to replace the .bmad-core folder"

## Selected Approach

**Option 1: Function-Based Structure** was chosen and implemented, providing:
- Intuitive naming that clearly describes each folder's purpose
- User-friendly navigation for new users
- Logical grouping of related components
- Scalable architecture for future enhancements
- Professional software project patterns

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Folder Structure Migration

#### Before (BMAD Structure):
```
validation_strategist/
├── .bmad-core/          # Hidden, confusing name
│   ├── agents/          # Contains the main prompt
│   ├── tasks/           # Workflow processes
│   ├── templates/       # Output templates
│   ├── commands/        # Command definitions
│   ├── checklists/      # Quality validation
│   ├── data/           # Knowledge base
│   └── utils/          # Supporting tools
├── input files/        # Architecture docs (space in name)
├── validation strategy/ # Generated outputs
└── output/            # Other outputs
```

#### After (Function-Based Structure):
```
validation_strategist/
├── agent/              # Agent configuration and prompts
├── workflows/          # Task workflows and processes
├── templates/          # Output templates
├── checklists/         # Quality validation checklists
├── knowledge_base/     # Reference data and patterns
├── tools/             # Utility scripts and processors
├── input_files/       # Architecture documents (renamed)
├── validation_strategy/# Generated validation strategies
├── output/            # Other generated outputs
└── docs/              # Documentation and help
```

### 2. File Migrations

| Source | Destination | Files Moved |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `.bmad-core/agents/` | `agent/` | validation_strategist.prompt.md |
| `.bmad-core/tasks/` | `workflows/` | 5 workflow files |
| `.bmad-core/templates/` | `templates/` | 6 template files |
| `.bmad-core/checklists/` | `checklists/` | 2 checklist files |
| `.bmad-core/data/` | `knowledge_base/` | 3 knowledge base files |
| `.bmad-core/utils/` | `tools/` | 4 utility scripts |
| `input files/` | `input_files/` | Renamed for consistency |

### 3. Reference Updates

#### Agent Prompt Updates:
- Updated all file path references to new structure
- Changed "BMAD-compliant" to "Function-based modular structure"
- Updated document processing rules to reference "tools" instead of "utils"
- Modified core principles to reflect new architecture

#### Workflow File Updates:
- Updated 18 references across 5 workflow files
- Changed "Utils:" to "Tools:" in dependency sections
- Added full path references (e.g., `templates/validation-strategy-tmpl.yaml`)
- Maintained functionality while improving clarity

### 4. Documentation Creation

#### New Documentation Files:
- `docs/README.md` - Comprehensive user guide and reference
- `docs/quick_start.md` - 5-minute getting started guide

#### Documentation Features:
- Complete folder structure explanation
- Command reference with examples
- Input/output specifications
- Best practices and troubleshooting
- Professional formatting and organization

### 5. Agent Name Clarification

Changed the agent's presentation name from "Val" to "Validation Strategist" to avoid confusion when multiple validation-related agents are deployed in the same environment. This provides:
- **Clear Identity**: Full descriptive name instead of abbreviation
- **Disambiguation**: Prevents confusion between validation agents
- **Professional Presentation**: Formal name for business contexts
- **Consistency**: Aligns with the agent's title and purpose

### 6. Checklist Folder Correction

Corrected the folder structure by creating a dedicated `checklists/` folder and moving checklist files from `templates/` to their proper location:
- **Proper Separation**: Checklists now have their own dedicated folder
- **Logical Organization**: Templates and checklists are properly separated
- **Better Maintainability**: Each content type has its appropriate location
- **Improved Clarity**: Users can easily find quality validation checklists

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Improved User Experience
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Folder names clearly indicate their purpose
